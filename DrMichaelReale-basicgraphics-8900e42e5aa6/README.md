BasicGraphics
=============

This is a very basic OpenGL sample for use in SUNY Polytechnic Institute's CS 450/548 Computer Graphics course.  It has the following dependencies:

- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- GLM
- Assimp
- stb_image
- stb_image_write

The shaders are set up to work with OpenGL version 3.3.

When running, it should display a window with a darkish green background with a green square in the upper-left corner, a blue square in the upper-right corner, and a red square in the lower-left corner.  When the left mouse button is pressed, a small white square will follow the mouse.
